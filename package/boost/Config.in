config BR2_PACKAGE_BOOST
	bool "boost"
	default n
	help
	  The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
	  libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
	  Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
	  provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
	  suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
	  already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
	  upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
